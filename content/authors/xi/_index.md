I am a second-year CS Ph.D. candidate at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/), advised by Prof. [Jing Zhang](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~jingz31/). 
Previously, I graduated from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). 
My research interests lie in **computer vision** and **single-cell spatial transcriptomics**, with a particular focus on challenges related to **generative AI** and its applications in biological data analysis. 
My goal is to develop innovative computational methods to better understand cellular mechanisms in spatial contexts and their roles in various diseases. ![alt text](avatar_square.jpg)
