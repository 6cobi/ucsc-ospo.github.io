I am a fourth-year CS Ph.D. candidate at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/), advised by Prof. [Jing Zhang](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~jingz31/). 
Previously, I graduated from the [College of Control Science and Technology, Zhejiang University](http://www.cse.zju.edu.cn/english/). 
My main research goal is to develop trustworthy computational methods to understand single-cell gene regulation, especially in spatial contexts, and their contributions to various diseases.![alt text](avatar_square.jpg)
