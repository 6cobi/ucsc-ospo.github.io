Jeffrey Weekley is a cyberinfrastructure engineer, HPC manager, and the Director of Research IT at the University of California, Santa Cruz. He oversees the Hummingbird HPC cluster, a mid-scale system serving over 1,100 researchers, and leads efforts to expand its capabilities with a $1.8 million upgrade. Previously, he served as the Director of Cyberinfrastructure and Research Computing at UC Merced, where he built the universityâ€™s first dedicated research computing cluster, and at the Naval Postgraduate School, conducting research in advanced computing infrastructure such as high-speed networks, large-scale visualization and remote collaboration environments for defense-related applications. His expertise spans HPC architecture, research cybersecurity, and scalable infrastructure solutions for research computing. He plays a key role in developing research IT governance policies at UC Santa Cruz, with a focus on research cybersecurity, data management, and institutional cyberinfrastructure strategy. In his own research, Weekley studies on how generative AI may have benefits for post-secondary learners with cognitive and behavioral disabilities. He actively contributes to national research computing initiatives, collaborating with the National Research Platform (NRP), Campus Research Computing Consortium (CARCC), and other mid-scale cyberinfrastructure communities.
