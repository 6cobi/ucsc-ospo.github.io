Stephanie Lieggi, UCSC OSPO Executive Director, started at the UCSC Center for Research in Open Source Software (CROSS) in 2016. Lieggi led the effort to create an [OSPO Network in the University of California system](https://news.ucsc.edu/2024/04/uc-ospo-network.html). Stephanie has been involved with numerous efforts to promote open source and the OSPO approach more broadly in academia; this includes co-chairing the metrics focused CHAOSS University Working Group, and speaking about university OSPOs at open source events such as the Linux Foundation Open Source Summit North America, Free and Open Source Software Yearly (FOSSY) conference, and the Southern California Linux Expo (SCaLE).  Stephanie was also a co-PI on UCSC’s first National Science Foundation's Pathways to Enable Open Source Ecosystem (POSE) grant.  

Prior to starting at CROSS, Stephanie was a senior researcher and adjunct professor at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies, part of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey, where she researched the intersection of national security and global trade. In that role, Stephanie taught numerous nonproliferation related courses including ones focused on illicit trafficking and nonproliferation-related strategic trade controls. She was also the managing editor for two trade control related publications - the East Asian Export Control Observer and the International Export Control Observer. Stephanie received her MA in International Policy Studies from MIIS, and her bachelors in political science from the University of California, San Diego.
