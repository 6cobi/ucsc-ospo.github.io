# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am Abel Souza, an Assistant Professor at UCSC. My research centers on expanding the understanding of computing systems, from small embedded devices to large scale data centers, encompassing resource planning and the deployment of optimal strategies for distributed and data-intensive systems that support AI, Machine Learning, and web workloads. Recently, my work has expanded into sustainable, carbon-aware approaches to designing and managing cloud data centers and cyber physical systems, with the goal of achieving zero-carbon operations. I completed my bachelor degree from the Universidade Federal Fluminense in Brazil, was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and earned my Ph.D. at Umeå University.
