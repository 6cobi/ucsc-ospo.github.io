I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) in Computer Science in my final semester. My research ties multiple domains together via non-blackbox Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) modeling. Prior to joining PhD at UNL, I taught Embedded Systems Applications course at UNL. At UNL I was a recipient of outstanding graduate researcher award and multiple teaching awards. My current outside collaborations include a computational biology-based project with Argonne National Laboratory (ANL at the University of Chicago). I also spent two stints as a graduate research fellow at Adobe Research (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). I am also actively involved in research conference activities in the field of communication networks.
