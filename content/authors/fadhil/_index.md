I am Fadhil I. Kurnia, currently a CS PhD candidate at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. I have broad interests in Distributed and Networked Systems, Storage Systems, and Systems for Machine Learning. I am the recipient of the Jim Gray Scholarship for CS systems researcher in 2021.

Currently, I am working on building highly efficient and privacy-preserving distributed systems with Arun Venkataramani in the Advanced Networked Systems Research Group. I also actively collaborate with Marco Serafini on efficient systems for machine learning. I am very fortunate to worked with Haryadi S. Gunawi and Huaicheng Li from the UCARE Lab, University of Chicago.
