I am Dr. Zahmeeth Sayed Sakkaff. I will be joining WVU Tech (Beckley) and WVU (Morgantown) as an Assistant Professor with a joint appointment in the Computer Science Department starting Fall 2025. Currently, I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at St. Bonaventure University. I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering and an M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, and an M.Phil. in Computer Science from the University of Peradeniya. 
Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Scientist in the Data Science and Learning Division at Argonne National Laboratory for four and a half years, with a joint appointment at the University of Chicago under the CASE program. My research focuses on AI and machine learning, computational biology, bioinformatics, molecular communication, and information theory. I have published extensively and received multiple accolades, including two Best Paper Awards and the 2018-2019 Dean’s Fellowship from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.  I am passionate about student mentorship and open-source research. As a AWIS-CAC President, our team earned the Shooting Star Award for excellence in student mentoring in 2022.
