I am a Senior Research Advisor at Shearwater GeoServices.

Previously, I was an Assistant Professor at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in the Earth Science and Engineering program, part of the Physical Science and Engineering division. I led the Deep Imaging Group, I was a member of the Extreme Computing Research Center; moreover, together with my colleague Professor Tariq Alkalifah I created the DeepWave consortium.

Prior to that, I worked in Equinor, both as research scientist and reservoir geophysicist. During my time in industry I contributed to the development of geophysical technologies aimed at identifying new discoveries as well as increasing hydrocarbon recovery of existing reservoirs. I have also been involved in the development of several open-source software packages to ease the use of geophysical data and improve reproducibility in the area of inverse problems.

I earned a PhD in Geophysics from the University of Edinburgh as part of the Edinburgh Interferomety Project under the supervision of Prof. Andrew Curtis. My research contributions spanned across the fields of seismic processing, imaging, and inversion through the development of novel methods aimed at using high-order reverberations to improve the quality and resolution of subsurface imaging products.Yuxi Hong is a postdoctoral research fellow in the Performance and Algorithms group of the Computer Science Department at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). He received an MS degree in Electronics Engineering from Tsinghua University and a BSc from Tsinghua University. His current research interests include HPC, Numerical Linear Algebra, GPU programming, sparse computation, low rank methods and efficient Machine Learning/ Deep learning.
