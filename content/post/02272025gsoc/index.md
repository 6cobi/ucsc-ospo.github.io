We are excited to have once again been selected as a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) Mentor Organization. The [2025 Open Source Research Experience](/osre25) (and with it the [2024 Summer of Reproducibility](/sor25) ) will once again benefit from GSOC's world-wide outreach and generous funding of contributors. We are now listed among [185 selected mentor organizations](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/organizations). See our [organization page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2025/organizations/uc-ospo)) on the GSoC 2025 site.
