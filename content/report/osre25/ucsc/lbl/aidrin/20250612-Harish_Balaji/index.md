**Reading time: 4‚Äì5 minutes**

Hi üëã

I‚Äôm Harish Balaji, a Master‚Äôs student at NYU with a focus on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Cybersecurity. I‚Äôm especially interested in building scalable systems that reflect responsible AI principles. For me, data quality isn‚Äôt just a technical detail. It‚Äôs a foundational aspect of building models that are reliable, fair, and reproducible in the real world.

This summer, I‚Äôm contributing to AIDRIN (AI Data Readiness Inspector) as part of Google Summer of Code 2025. I‚Äôm grateful to be working under the mentorship of Dr. Jean Luca Bez and Prof. Suren Byna from the [Scientific Data Management Group](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/scidata/sdm/) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL).

AIDRIN is an open-source framework that helps researchers and practitioners evaluate whether a dataset is truly ready to be used in production-level AI workflows. From fairness to privacy, it provides a structured lens through which we can understand the strengths and gaps in our data.

## Why this work matters

In machine learning, one principle always holds true:  
> "Garbage in, garbage out."

Even the most advanced models can underperform or amplify harmful biases if trained on incomplete, imbalanced, or poorly understood data. This is where AIDRIN steps in. It provides practical tools to assess datasets across key dimensions like privacy, fairness, class balance, interpretability, and support for multiple modalities such as images, text, and audio.

By making these characteristics measurable and transparent, AIDRIN empowers teams to make informed decisions early in the pipeline. It helps ensure that datasets are not only large or complex, but also trustworthy, representative, and purpose-fit.

## My focus this summer

As part of my GSoC 2025 project, I‚Äôll be focusing on extending AIDRIN‚Äôs evaluation capabilities. A big part of this involves strengthening its support for privacy metrics and designing tools that can handle non-tabular datasets, such as image-based data.

The goal is to expand AIDRIN‚Äôs reach without compromising on interpretability or ease of use. More technical insights and updates will follow in the next posts as the summer progresses.

## What comes next

As the AI community continues to evolve, there‚Äôs a growing shift toward data-centric practices. I believe frameworks like AIDRIN are essential for helping us move beyond the question of ‚ÄúDoes the model work?‚Äù toward a deeper and more meaningful one: ‚ÄúWas the data ready in the first place?‚Äù

Over the next few weeks, I‚Äôll be working on development, testing, and integration. I‚Äôm excited to contribute to a tool that emphasizes transparency and reproducibility across the AI lifecycle, and to share lessons and ideas with others who care about responsible AI.

If you‚Äôre exploring similar challenges or working in the space of dataset evaluation and readiness, I‚Äôd love to connect and exchange thoughts. You can also read my full GSoC 2025 proposal below for more context around the project scope and vision:
