Hi, I‚Äôm Harish Balaji üëã

I'm a Master's student at NYU with a focus on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Cybersecurity. I‚Äôm especially interested in the intersection of scalable systems and responsible AI and how the quality of our datasets directly impacts the reliability of the models we train on them.

This summer, through **GSoC 2025**, I‚Äôll be contributing to **AIDRIN** (AI Data Readiness Inspector), a framework designed to evaluate the ‚Äúreadiness‚Äù of datasets for real-world AI workflows. I‚Äôll be working under the guidance of Dr. Jean Luca Bez and Prof. Suren Byna from the [Scientific Data Management Group](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/scidata/sdm/) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL).

AIDRIN addresses a critical yet often overlooked issue in machine learning: *garbage in, garbage out*. No matter how powerful your model is, poor-quality data will always hold it back. AIDRIN helps data scientists assess their datasets across dimensions like:

- **Privacy** 
- **Fairness and Balance**
- **Interpretability** 
- **Multimodal Support, etc.**

You can read my full **Google Summer of Code 2025** proposal [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RUyU2fHkc8GZ9vTj5SUr6jj84ZaRUvNt/view).

**My project focuses on two key goals**:
1. Strengthening AIDRIN‚Äôs privacy and evaluation metrics for structured/tabular data  
2. Extending the framework to support image-based datasets and readiness assessments using deep vision embeddings

I‚Äôm excited to contribute to a tool that puts **responsible AI and transparency** front and center and I hope that by the end of the summer, researchers will have a more robust, interpretable, and reproducible way to prepare their data.
