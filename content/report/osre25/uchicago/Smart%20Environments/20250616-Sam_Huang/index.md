Hi everyone, I'm Sam! I'm excited to be working with the Argonne National Laboratory and SoR this summer on Smart Environments. Have you ever encountered a great opensource project and wanted to run it or use it locally, only to find that it's such a headache to set up all the dependencies? Maybe your system version wasn't correct, or a piece of software was outdated, or the dependencies were incompatible with something you had already on your machine.

That is the problem we are trying to solve. We aim to build an agent that would help reproduce opensource projects by automatically setting up the environmental dependencies required to get them running.
