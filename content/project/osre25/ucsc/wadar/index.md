[WaDAR](https://github.com/jlab-sensing/wadar) (Water Radar) is an innovative, low-cost, hybrid approach to soil moisture sensing that combines the benefits of in-ground (in situ) and remote sensing technologies. Traditional soil moisture measurement methods suffer from drawbacks: in situ sensors are expensive and difficult to maintain, while remote sensing offers lower accuracy and resolution. WaDAR bridges this gap by using inexpensive underground backscatter tags paired with above-ground radars, enabling completely wireless, high-resolution soil moisture monitoring.

## Key Features of WaDAR
- Uses **RF backscatter tags** buried underground to provide high-accuracy soil moisture readings.
- Uses **ultra-wideband radar** for above-ground sensing.
- Offers an average error of just 1.4%, comparable to state-of-the-art commercial sensors.
- Reduces deployment costs significantly, making it accessible for widespread agricultural use.
- Supports real-time, scalable, and maintenance-free soil moisture monitoring for farmers.
