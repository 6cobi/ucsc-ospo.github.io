Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed various fields by demonstrating remarkable capabilities in processing and generating human-like text. This project aims to explore the development of an open-source framework that leverages LLMs to enhance discovery across specialized domains.

The proposed framework will enable LLMs to analyze and interpret complex datasets, automate routine tasks, and uncover novel insights. A key focus will be on equipping LLMs with domain-specific expertise, particularly in areas where specialized tools -- such as ANDES -- are not widely integrated with LLM-based solutions. By bridging this gap, the framework will empower researchers and professionals to harness LLMs as intelligent assistants capable of navigating and utilizing niche computational tools effectively.
