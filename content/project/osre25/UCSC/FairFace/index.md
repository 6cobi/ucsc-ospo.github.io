This project investigates potential demographic and occupational biases in images generated by Stable Diffusion models when prompted with text that implies social attributes (e.g., profession, status). It builds on prior work analyzing racial and gender bias in language models, extending the lens to visual generation.

Our goal is to create a reproducible pipeline for:
- Generating images from prompts
- Annotating or analyzing them using computer vision tools
- Measuring bias across categories like skin tone, gender presentation, or status markers
